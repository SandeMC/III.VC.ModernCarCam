III.VC.SA.ModernCarCam
======================

A modern vehicle camera for GTA III, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas.

======================

Installation
-------

1. Install an ASI loader (for example Silent's ASI Loader - https://github.com/GTAmodding/ASI-Loader/releases/latest or Ultimate ASI Loader - https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader.
2. Copy III.VC.SA.ModernCarCam.asi and III.VC.SA.ModernCarCam.ini into the scripts folder or game folder.
3. Edit III.VC.SA.ModernCarCam.ini and set Profile to the camera you want. Everything else is optional.

For Widescreen Fix users: this mod takes over the Widescreen Fix's own Speed Sensitive FOV and VCS Camera Shake options: both are forced off in WSF while this mod is installed, so this mod's DynamicSpeedFOV and VCSCamShake settings are authoritative (the code is the same, this is done to avoid confusion)

For Drive-by mods users:
- Modernized Driveby features have been reimplemented in this mod; I wouldn't recommend using both mods at once
- Manual Driveby VC - https://libertycity.net/files/gta-vice-city/213323-manual-driveby-vc.html),
  Manual Driveby III - https://libertycity.net/files/gta-3/213322-manual-driveby-iii.html
  and Manual Driveby Refixed (SA) - https://libertycity.net/files/gta-san-andreas/213857-manual-driveby-refixed.html
  are the only "Manual" style mods tested against this mod and verified to be compatible

Debug menu
----------
When the game's debug menu (https://libertycity.net/files/gta-san-andreas/161611-debugmenu.html) is available, the mod adds a **ModernCarCam** section to it with live toggles for every feature.

Per-car cameras
---------------
Any single car can have its own camera, separate from the global Profile, by adding a section named "Car" plus the car's model id or model name to the ini - for example [Car400] for model id 400, or [CarHOTRING] for the car whose model name is hotring. A section can name several cars by separating them with commas ([Car494,502,503] or [Carhotring,hotrina,hotrinb]). Distance, FOV, angles (near/middle/far), the Custom camera shape and every [Offsets] value can be set per car; an omitted key keeps the global value. Add as many sections as you like. See the end of III.VC.SA.ModernCarCam.ini for the full key list and examples.
